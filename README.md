## Project Overview :
Apple has set an ambitious target to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
This involves a two-fold strategy:
1. Reducing emissions by 75% from 2015 levels.
2. Offsetting the remaining 25% (approximately 9.6 million metric tons CO2e) through robust carbon removal programs.

This project aims to analyze Apple’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data using Power BI to:
- Evaluate progress towards the 2030 emissions target.
- Identify trends and key areas for further improvement.
- Assess the effectiveness of current carbon offset initiatives.

## Data Source :
Dataset : [Apple's Greenhouse Gas Emission](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?accessType=open&dataStructure=Multiple%20tables&order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=3&pageSize=5)

## Key Objectives :
1. **2030 Emissions Target Outlook** :
 Analyze Apple’s progress towards reducing emissions by 75% and evaluate whether they are on track to exceed this target.

2. **Carbon Offset Progress** :
Measure the impact of existing carbon offset initiatives and identify gaps to bridge the remaining CO2e.

3. **Insights and Recommendations** :
Generate actionable insights for scaling emission reduction and offset programs.

## Power BI Implementation Plan :
### Data Import and Preparation :
- Import datasets into Power BI from CSV format.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Create measures to facilitate analysis.

### Dashboard Components :
1. **Trend Analysis** :
- Year-over-year emissions trends.
- Progress towards the 75% reduction target.

2. **Carbon Offset Analysis** :
- Overview of current offset initiatives.
- Progress towards addressing the 4.3 million metric tons CO2e gap.
- Forecast of offset scaling needed by 2030.

3. **Recommendations Dashboard** :
- Areas for additional emission reduction.
- Suggestions for expanding carbon removal initiatives.
- Cost-benefit analysis of potential solutions.

## Key Visualizations :
- Line charts for emissions trends over time.
- Pie charts showing emissions breakdown by category.
- Bar graphs for offset program contributions.

## Conclusion :
- **2030 Emissions Target Outlook** :
The forecast indicates that Apple is on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target and may even exceed it, potentially reducing the need for carbon offsets.

- **Carbon Offset Progress and 2030 Gap** :
Apple's carbon offset efforts are increasing, but to achieve the 2030 net zero target, they must significantly scale up their initiatives to cover the remaining CO2e gap. This involves both further reducing emissions and expanding offset programs.
